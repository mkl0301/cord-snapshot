# Welcome to CORD

This repository is an entry point to CORD's open reference
implementation. It helps you to build and deploy CORD.


### What is CORD

CORD (Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter) is a
revolutionary concept to turn Telco Central Offices (and MSO Head
Ends) into a modern mini-datacenters. We call this a CORD POD. A
POD is made up of commodity servers, switches, and other networking
devices.  The POD is an application deployment platform optimized for
both conventional cloud-scale applications as well as virtual network
functions (VNF).

### What is the CORD Reference Implementation

The CORD open reference implementation is comprised of:

- A number of POD hardware specifications that can serve as reference
  implementations

- A software platform that when deployed on the servers implements
  service-agnostic software infrastructure enabling deployment of
  sophisticated network services

- A few sample service implementations that can be readily deployed
  onto CORD PODs

- A deployment automation framework that simplifies the installation
  of the platform layers as well as the sample services

- An extendable test framework and test suite to verify and
  characterize the platfrom as well as the sample services

- Extensive documentation to work with CORD

### Quick Start

If this is your first encounter with CORD, you may consider giving it
a quick spin. We made it real easy. You can bring up CORD on a single
server or on a few servers (with or without a real fabric) with a few
commands.

Please follow our [Quick Start Tutorial](docs/quickstart.md).
